**Android app project facilitating the auctioning for running errands**

## Overview

The project is an Android application which provides a portal for the users to notify others about their upcoming excursions and start auctions, specifying the details such as date and time of their excursion, where they can accept orders from fellow customers who participate in these auctions by specifying their bids in the form of the extra fee they are willing to pay for their orders.

At the end of the auction, the service provider can select the certain number of top bids it is willing to cater to following which both the service provider and the customer whose order in the form of bid is confirmed are shown their identity using which they can contact each other for the fulfillment of the order at the extra fee decided by the system.

The app provides the added functionality to rate the users and provide feedback along with the facility to the user to view its own feedback that will allow future participants to make better decisions and also help in moderating the usage of the app.
